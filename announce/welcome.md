# Welcome to CSCI 688

Welcome to data mining and statistical learning. 

A few beginning of course announcements. Remember: This is a remote and asynchronous course.

# Website

Information for the course can be found on blackboard or at gjhunt.github.io/688spring2021

# Lectures

The lectures are remote and asynchronous. Each week I will post two lectures for that week which will each be ~60 minutes long. They will be posted to youtube with links posted on the github page. I will also post a .pdf of the lecture notes from that week along with the videos.

Additionally, I'll be posting a lab component corresponding to most lectures that will be ~ 20 minutes long. 

** The first lecture/lab will be posted this Thursday. **

# Book

There is no required book for this course. My lectures/notes should be enough to do everything in the course. Since many students understandably like an accompanying text. I'll suggest two books: 

1. Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshriani and Friedman: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/

This is an advanced undergraduate/masters level book. My lectures will follow along with these topics to a certain extent. This book is freely available online. I'll post relevant sections of this book one should consider reading. 

2. An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani: https://www.statlearning.com/

This is a more undergraduate-friendly text. Again, this is freely available online. 

# Office Hours

Office hours will be held on zoom at https://cwm.zoom.us/my/gjhunt, times will be Tuesdays 4-5 PM EST and Wednesday 9-10AM EST. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email gjhunt@wm.edu

** Office hours will begin next week. **

# Datacamp Assignments

We'll have programming assignments on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com). A free account can be signed up for [here](). In total, datacamp assignment will be worth 10% of the final grade. These assignments will be posted throughout the course and due a week after posted at 11:59 PM EST.

# Problem Sets (PSs)

Additionally, there will be longer-form problem sets assigned throughout the course. These will involve mathematical derivations as well as coding. PSs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. These will typically be due two weeks after assignment uploaded on blackboard by 11:59. I will grade these by spot-grading the assignments -- randomly choosing a problem from those assigned to grade. Problem sets must be written in R markdown. 

# Midterm

There will be a written midterm exam Tuesday March 23rd 7-8:30 PM EST. More information will be given closer to that date. The midterm will account for 30% of the final grade.

# Final

In lieu of an exam, the final for this course will be a group project with presentations and writeup. Currently, the final presentation time-slot is Tuesday May 18th 7-10 PM EST. This may change so that we can find a time that works well for everyone. The final project writeup will account for 30% of the final grade and the presentation to the class will account for 10% of the final grade. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if there are questions of concerns. My email is ghunt@wm.edu.
